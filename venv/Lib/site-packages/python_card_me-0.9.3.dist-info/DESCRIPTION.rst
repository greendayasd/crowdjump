Python-Card-Me parses iCalendar and vCard files into Python data structures,
decoding the relevant encodings.
It can also serialize vobject data structures to iCalendar, vCard, or hCalendar unicode strings.

It is a substantially reworked version of Vobject, updated for python3, with other improvements.

Requirements
------------

Requires Python 2.7 or later, dateutil (http://labix.org/python-dateutil) 2.4 or later, and six.
