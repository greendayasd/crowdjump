    Thank you for visiting Crowdjump! <br>
    In this follow-up study to the well received original Crowdjump you can experience the design progress of a video game and maybe even decide the further development while helping with a student project! <br>
    <div ng-show="false">If you want to participate in upcoming studies (when they start in a few weeks), fill out the following form!</div>
        <div class="btn-group" ng-show="false">

                <i aria-hidden="true"></i> following form!
            </a>
        </div>
    <br>
    The study will take about 3 weeks, starting on February 3rd. While the game will evolve daily, you are free to decide when and how often you play yourself!<br><br>

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
    <h4> Everyday new features are implemented in Crowdjump the game as well as on the website! Be sure to check the progress regularly!<br>

=======
    <h4 ng-show="true"> We needed to take the study offline, as there were signs of data alteration. While some passwords were not working anymore,
        all passwords were safely encrypted in PBKDF2-SHA256. There was no sign that hackers got to read any information.<br>
        We still recommend you change the password for services where you have used the same password as in Crowdjump.
